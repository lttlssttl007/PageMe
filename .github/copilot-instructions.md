This project is a full-stack web application with a React frontend (Vite + TypeScript) and a Node.js/Express backend. The app includes user and admin login screens, and uses MongoDB Atlas for authentication. Prioritize clean separation of frontend and backend code, and ensure secure handling of credentials.
